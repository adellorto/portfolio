## Projects

<br>

### 🛣️ Road Network Agent-Based Model  
Python-based analysis of **Bangladesh’s road network** using Road Maintenance Management System (RMMS) data. Developed over three assignments for the MSc course *Advanced Simulation* at **TU Delft**, the project computes **vulnerability** and **criticality** metrics for roads and bridges.

📁 Python, Data Analysis, Network Metrics  
📊 Workflow: Model optimization → Metric computation → Reporting 
📦 Includes scripts, plots, CSV outputs, and a final report  
👥 Collaborated with four peers

### 🔌 Microcontrollers  
A collection of solutions to past exam exercises from the **Microcontrollers** course of the BSc in Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. Projects are based on the **PIC18F45K22** microcontroller and developed using **MikroC**.

📁 C, MikroC, Embedded Systems  
⚙️ Topics: LCD control, timers, ADC, PWM motor control, interrupts   
📚 Contains official exam exercises and hardware datasheets
